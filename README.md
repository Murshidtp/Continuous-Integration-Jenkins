# CI/CD Implementation Using Jenkins

## Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of an automated CI/CD pipeline for a Python-based application using Jenkins. The goal is to achieve faster and more reliable software delivery through automation. The pipeline is designed to seamlessly integrate and configure various tools such as Jenkins, AWS, Docker, Git, and GitHub.

## Features

- Automated CI/CD pipeline for Python applications.
- Integration with Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous deployment.
- Seamless integration with AWS for deployment and hosting.
- Docker for containerization of the application.
- Version control using Git and GitHub.
- Webhooks for triggering automated processes.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- Jenkins
- AWS
- Docker
- Git
- GitHub account

## Setup

### 1. Jenkins Installation and Configuration

Follow the official [Jenkins installation guide](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/) to set up Jenkins. Configure Jenkins with necessary plugins and credentials for AWS and GitHub.

### 2. AWS Configuration

Set up AWS credentials and configure the necessary services (e.g., EC2) for hosting and deploying your application.

### 3. Docker Installation

Install Docker following the instructions provided in the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### 4. Git and GitHub

Make sure you have Git installed on your local machine. Create a repository on GitHub for your Python application.

### 5. Jenkins Pipeline

Create a Jenkins pipeline script (Jenkinsfile) to define your CI/CD process. This script should include stages for building, testing, and deploying your Python application.

### 6. Webhooks

Set up GitHub webhooks to trigger the Jenkins pipeline on code pushes. Configure Jenkins to listen to these webhooks.

## Usage

1. Commit your Python application code to the GitHub repository.
2. Jenkins will automatically detect the changes through webhooks and trigger the CI/CD pipeline.
3. The pipeline will build and push docker images into Dockerhub
